## Array

A fixed size collection of elements of the saeme data type sote ed in contigous memory locations is called Aarray. All the elements are represented by a single name called array name. Arrary elements are also accessed by that given name only.

## Features of Array

1. Homogeneous Data only same type elements values can be store.
2. Static data structure it s size cannot be changed during prohram execution(runtime).
3. Contigueous Memmory Allocation Elements of an arrray are stored in adjacent (contigeous) memory locations.
4. Zero based indexing the first elements of an arrary is accessed usig index 0, the second at indes 1 and so on.
5. Random accrss elements can be accessed dirsctly using theri index.

## Terminology of Array

1. Name - name of the array.
2. Size - no of elements to store in to the array.
3. Type - type of elementms to be store
4. Index - Sub script vales of an array.
5. Base the 0th element value is called base value and its address is called base address.

## Type of Array

1. One Dimensional Array (1D).
2. Multidimensional Array (ND).

## Single Dimensional Array

If an array is defined with single dimensional value then such array is called single dimensional array. Elements, accressed with a single index.


## Declaration of single dimensional array

#### Sntax
Type arrayname[size]

Example
int Arr[10]; // here array name is Arr that allow to store 10 no. of integer elements in a sequential order.

## Memory Representaion of 1D Array

In 1D array, the given size represents memory size of the array. it gives individual memoray address to store the data values.

## Representaion and calculation of 1D Aarry

As per formula A[4] = (base address of first element) + (size of the element * index)

## Initialization of 1D Array

#### Syntax
Type of arrname[size] = {elements};

## Accessing Elements

Array elements are accessed using zero based indexing within square brackets []. The first element is at index 0. and last element is at index size -1.
