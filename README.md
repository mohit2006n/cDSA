# Linked list

Collection of nodes where each node points to the next

Last node will points to Null

Head know the starting point of the linked list


Data ---- pointer/link/next

Head points to first data
link/next points to next data by storing address

[Data and Next] - Node





# Topics

1. Creation

2. Tranversal

3. Insert 
    at Beginig
    at End
    at any position
    after a specific value

4. Delete
    at Beginig
    at End
    at any position
    after a specific value

5. Merge 2 linked list

6. Reverse the linked list

7. Sorting linked list in accending order value

8. Remove duplicate value




# STACK
--------

LIFO (Last in first out)

1. Static
    Arrary

Arrary or string name is constant pointer to itself

Special pointer TOS - Top of stack
Always TOS starts with -1

if TOS = -1 it is empty
if TOS = MAX -1 it is full (MAX is the size of the array)

2. Dynamic
    Linked list


# Operation in Stack

1. peep
2. push
3. pop


# Queue

It follows the principle of "First in, First out" (FIFO), where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.
